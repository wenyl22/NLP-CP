## one-shot prompt for the cluster

cluster_sys_prompt = "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.You need to judge if two steps in a math solution get the same conclusion. You will be given the math problem, the first x steps to solve it, and two possibilities of the next step. Your task is to judge if they are the same. Format your response as one single word: Same/Different. Do not say anything else.\n"

extract_sys_prompt = "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant. You will be given one step within a step-by-step solution of some math problem. You need to extract the key conclusion of the step and make it simple. Do not say anything else.\n"


cluster_sys_prompt2 = "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant. You will be given a math problem, the first x steps to solve it, and a list of possible next steps. Each possibility will be marked as **[1]**, **[2]**, **[3]**, etc. Your task is to cluster similar responses. For example, if **[1]** and **[3]** are the same, while **[2]** is different from them, you should format your response as: **[1, 3]**, **[2]**. You should make sure each given possibility is included one and only one cluster. Do not say anything else.\n"

cluster_sys_prompt3= "You are a helpful assistant. You will be given a math problem and two intermediate conclusions of solving the problem, which may not be the final answer. Your task is to judge if the two conclusions are the same. Format your response as one single word: Same/Different. Do not say anything else.\n"
